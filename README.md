### Hack Western Android Application

## Team Members: Purnima Mehta, James Pang, Ansaf Ahmad, Sagar Thomas

Shopping during the holiday reason can be a nightmare with long checkout lines. 
Easily skip those lines now using CHECKOUT. Scan and pay with your phone, show the receipt when you leave and its as seamless as that.

## Inspiration
Holiday season is coming up but it can be tiring standing in long lines and you could be missing on the next biggest sale at another store.

## What it does
Scans the store ID, allows you to start scanning product UPC codes, puts them in a virtual shopping cart and you can pay using PayPal or VISA.

## How it was built
We decided to build an android app which required Java and Android studio. Also we had to use a database and OrchestrateIO provided a database as a service which allowed us to easily store data in the form of a dictionary. The backend is hosted on Amazon AWS and is built using the Flask framework for python.

## Challenges
Setting up a secure payment system was a struggle as no one had experience with that before. Android Studio was also difficult but a learning experience nonetheless.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
As a team, we're proud we were able to finish this hack in a short amount of time and still learn a lot about android app development.

## What's next?
Next, CHECKOUT can be scalable and have a better UI. Adding a more secure payment system and expanding it to countries beyond Canada.
