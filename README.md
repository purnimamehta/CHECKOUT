Hack Western Checkout Application

Team Members: Purnima Mehta, Ansaf Ahmad, Sagar Thomas, James Pang

Shopping during the holiday reason can be a nightmare with long checkout lines. 
Easily skip those lines now using CHECKOUT. Scan and pay with your phone, show the receipt when you leave and its as seamless as that.


Inspiration
Holiday season is coming up but it can be tiring standing in long lines and you could be missing on the next biggest sale at another store.

What it does
Scans the store ID, allows you to start scanning product UPC codes, puts them in a virtual shopping cart and you can pay using PayPal or VISA.

How I built it
We decided to build an android app which required Java and Android studio. Also we had to use a database and OrchestrateIO provided a database as a service which allowed us to easily store data in the form of a dictionary. The backend is hosted on Amazon AWS and is built using the Flask framework for python.

Challenges I ran into
Setting up a secure payment system was a struggle as no one had experience with that before. Android Studio was also difficult but a learning experience nonetheless.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Didn't get much sleep (haha). As a team, we're proud we were able to finish this hack in a short amount of time and still learn a lot about android app development.

What I learned
How to make a request to connect front end to backend. Do not drink too much redbull! Get some sleep next time.

What's next for CHECKOUT
Next, CHECKOUT can be scalable and have a better UI. Adding a more secure payment system and expanding it to countries beyond Canada.
